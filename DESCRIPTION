    1. The estimated coefficient vector(including the intercept);
    2. Initial coefficient vector; and
    3. Bootstrap Confidence intervals; and
    4. The fitted logistic curve; and
    5. Confusion Matrix; and
    6. Six metrics(Prevalence, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, False Discovery Rate,Diagnostic Odds Ratio); and
    7. The evaluation chart of the metrics with different cut-off values.
